            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It
                uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser.
                Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example,
                there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a
                list.</p>
            <p>The HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web and its original use case. Pages usually
                contained static documents that contained references to other documents. These references contained
                hypertext links used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user could read the
                reference document without having to manually search for it.</p>
            <p>A few things you can do with HTML...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Headlines using h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 & h6 elements</li>
                <li>Inform with paragraph elements</li>
                <li>Fill in the blank placeholder text</li>
                <li>Comment out and Uncomment HTML</li>
                <li>Add Images and Videos to your Website</li>

            </ul>
            <div>This is HTML example code:

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in
                HTML.
                Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization.</p>
            <p>There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements
                with the style attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document.
                Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML
                document. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style
                sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements. This improves the readability and
                reusability of your code.

            <p>The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object
                Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the
                page.
            </p>
            <p>In this section, you'll see how adding CSS styles to the elements of your CatPhotoApp can change it from
                simple text to something more.</p>
            <p>A few things you can do...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Change the Color of Text</li>
                <li>Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements</li>
                <li>Use CSS Class to Style an Element</li>
                <li>Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class</li>
                <li>Change the Font Size and Family of an element</li>
                <li>Add Borders around your Elements</li>

            <p>Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography, color theory, graphics,
                animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message. The definition of good design is a
                well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme</p>
            <p>At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information. The visual design of the page can
                influence its presentation and a user's experience. In web development, HTML gives structure and
                semantics to a page's content, and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.</p>
            <p>This section covers some of the basic tools developers use to create their own visual designs.</p>
            <p>A few things you can do...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create Visual Balance Using text-align Property</li>
                <li>Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property</li>
                <li>Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold</li>
                <li>Use the u tag to Underline Text</li>
                <li>Use the em tag to Italicize Text</li>
                <li>Use the s tag to Strikethrough Text</li>
            </ul>
            <div>This is example code:
                <br> 
            <code class="language-html">
                text-align: justify;

            <header class="section-header">Accessibility Principles</header>
            <p>"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood,
                navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory,
                mobility, or cognitive disabilities.</p>
            <p>Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some
                users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users
                may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind
                when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web.</p>
            <p>A few things you can do...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility</li>
                <li>Know when Alt text should be Left Blank</li>
                <li>Use Heading to Show Hierachical Relationships of Content</li>
                <li>Jump Straight to the Content Using the main Element</li>
                <li>Wrap Content in the article Element</li>

            <p>Today, there are many types of devices that can access the web. They range from large desktop computers
                to small mobile phones. These devices have different screen sizes, resolutions, and processing power.
                Responsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of
                different devices. The page structure and CSS rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences.
                In general, design the page's CSS to your target audience. If you expect most of your traffic to be from
                mobile users, take a 'mobile-first' approach. Then add conditional rules for larger screen sizes. If
                your visitors are desktop users, then design for larger screens with conditional rules for smaller
                sizes. CSS gives you the tools to write different style rules, then apply them depending on the device
                displaying the page. This section will cover the basic ways to use CSS for Responsive Web Design.</p>
            <p>A few things you can do...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a Media Query</li>
                <li>Use Media Query to make account for various devices</li>
                <li>Make an Image Responsive</li>
                <li>Use a Retina Image for Higher Resolution Displays</li>
                <li>Make a Typography Responsive</li>
            </ul>
            <div>This is CSS example code:

            <header class="section-header">CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid</header>
            <p>A website's User Interface ("UI") has two components. First, there are the visual elements, such as
                colors, fonts, and images. Second, there is the placement or positioning of those elements. In
                Responsive Web Design, a UI layout must accommodate many different browsers and devices accessing the
                content.</p>

            <p>CSS3 introduced Flexible Boxes, or flexbox, to create page layouts for a dynamic UI. It is a layout mode
                that arranges elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers. While somewhat new,
                all popular modern browsers support flexbox. This section covers how to use flexbox and the different
                layout options it offers.</p>
            <p>CSS Grid helps you easily build complex web designs. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid
                container with rows and columns for you to place children elements where you want within the grid.</p>
            <p>A few things you can do...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use display: flex to Position Two Boxes</li>
                <li>Apply flex-direction Property to Make a Row</li>
                <li>Align Elements Using the justify-content Property</li>
                <li>Add Columns with grid-template-columns</li>
                <li>Add rows with grid-template-rows</li>
                <li>Align an Item Horizontally using justify-self</li>
            </ul>
            <div>This is CSS example code:
                <br> 
            <code class="language-html">
                .container {
                    display: grid;
                    grid-template-columns: 50px 50px;
                  }
